# The Odin Project
## Project: Recipes
- The very first project from TOP, intended for practicing the first HTML lessons.
- What I've learned:
    - HTML boilerplate can be generated on VS Code using the Emmet Abreviation (type "!" on text editor and it will be triggered).
    - Formatting HTML (and other languages) with VS Code Prettier extension. I set it to Default Formatter in VS Code settings, now I can use the command Format Document (shortcut: ctrl + shift + i), which will make changes to code so it complies with formatting rules (e.g. using 2 spaces for indentation).
    - Sizing image is possible with the `style` attribute in the `<img>` tag, in this case I used width values at 250px or 400px and the height was automatically sized so the image didn't lose its proportions.
    - It's possible to live preview the html changes with the Live Preview extension on VS Code - it serves the website locally so you can navigate it on default browser.
    - Publish the webpage to GitHub pages.
